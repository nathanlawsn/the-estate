The 3 bedroom format works well for accommodating extended family,  friends, or children of different age groups. Benefitting from their proximity to Waterfall Woods, lodge guests frequently report badger and red squirrel sightings from their windows and verandas. And with red deer and over 50 different species of birds regularly sighted, the accommodation is a delight for nature lovers."
